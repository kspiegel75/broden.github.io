        <p>I tried to make a film reel with a strip of paper and an empty tape roll.It was abou cowman saying to a man that had his house burned down <em>"You need Cowman Insurence"</em>. and long story short, both of them burned.</p>

        <h6>Some time in 3rd grade</h6>

His story is that he was a speical bein in his univeres and left to earth and summoned 2 Thanoses and ripped the gauntlets off their hand and put them on his and melted them into his hands. </p>
